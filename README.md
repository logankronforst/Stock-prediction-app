This is a full-stack, HTML-based application that utilizes a time-series deep learning model to predict any given sticker symbol input by a user. It runs on the yfinance library historical market database, which has since been unfortunately deprecated. The application features multiple, dynamic visualizations that can display not only historical time series data but also the trend line generated by the neural network, and predict future stock prices. I completed this project with an electrical and computer engineer colleague, Paul McCaulley, and Economist Griffin Decker.
